/**Difference Between Error Vs Exception In Java**/

1)Errors:

-Errors in java are of type java.lang.Error
-All errors in java are unchecked type.
-Errors happen at run time. They will not be known to compiler.
-It is impossible to recover from errors.
-Errors are mostly caused by the environment in which application is running.

2)Exception:
 
-Exceptions in java are of type java.lang.Exception.
-Exceptions include both checked as well as unchecked type.
-Checked exceptions are known to compiler where as unchecked exceptions are not known to compiler because they occur at run time.
-You can recover from exceptions by handling them through try-catch blocks.
-Exceptions are mainly caused by the application itself.
-Examples :
